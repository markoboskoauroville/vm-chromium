# TAKEOVER

- 2.11.2026: the repository and the plan only; nothing installed on the VM yet (fresh Ubuntu 24.04 Minimal).
- 2.11.2026: Stage 1 files written by the cloud session (`stage1/`: setup.sh, session + Xvnc scripts, systemd units,
  policy, check.sh, measure-chromium-start.sh). Not yet run on the VM: this session has no tailnet access. Next: run
  `sudo ./stage1/setup.sh` on chromium-vm and `sudo ./stage1/check.sh --restart-test`.
