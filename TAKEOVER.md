# TAKEOVER

- 2.11.2026: the repository and the plan only; nothing installed on the VM yet (fresh Ubuntu 24.04 Minimal).
- 2.11.2026: Stage 1 files written by the cloud session (`stage1/`: setup.sh, session + Xvnc scripts, systemd units,
  policy, check.sh, measure-chromium-start.sh). Not yet run on the VM: this session has no tailnet access. Next: run
  `sudo ./stage1/setup.sh` on chromium-vm and `sudo ./stage1/check.sh --restart-test`.
- 2.11.2026 (Mac session): Stage 1 installed and verified on chromium-vm: Chromium 156.0.8078.73 (xtradeb deb),
  Xvnc on 100.102.86.30:5901 only, check.sh 7/7 incl. close-and-return, and 6/6 after a reboot. VNC password made
  on the VM, copy in ~/Downloads/API/chromium-vm-vnc.txt (never in the repo). Not yet: hand check with Mac Screen
  Sharing / phone, snap vs deb timing (measure-chromium-start.sh), Stage 2.
